<h2>EZ PC Hardware Information bash script! Aoya!</h2>

<p>What is good world?  It's Pharell.</p>
<p>My reason to make the script is simple, on some computers, getting hardware info is hard.  Some BIOS have no good info.  And you don't always remember what to grep on.  Idea here is to run the script in your live boot linux device, for example repair and drive utilities or live boot distros.  Get all important hardware info presented in easy to read fashion.</p>
<p>In the project i experiment with simple linux commands, like awk, sed, cat, and dmidecode.  Ah yes, for right now, it does rely on dmidecode.  Until better solution found.</p>
